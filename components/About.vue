        Hi, I am David, a passionate full stack software developer with a focus on building robust and user-friendly web applications. 

        <br />
        I have worked in the Digital Search Marketing industry for over 8 years, where I have honed my skills in software and web development.
        My great passion is creating technical solutions that solve real-world problems and enhance user experiences.
        Whether that be in time saving, cost saving or just making life easier.
        <br />
        I have a strong background in software development, with expertise in both front-end and back-end.
        I have experience in various technologies including .NET, C#, Vue.js, and React.js.

        I enjoy working with modern JavaScript frameworks like Vue.js and am always eager to learn new
        technologies. 
        My goal is to create solutions that make a positive impact
        and deliver great user experiences.

        <br />
