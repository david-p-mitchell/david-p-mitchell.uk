        Hi! Iâ€™m David, a full-stack software developer with a passion for building web applications that solve real problems and make life quicker, easier and ultimately better.

        <br />
        My software working life started at Halliburton where I worked on my placement year from Middlesex University, as a software engineer.
        There I worked on a project in connecting to an oven to control the temperature for the testing of drilling equipment. 
        Within this role, I worked with different managers to deliver a winforms app to help and see testing results of the equipment.
<br /><br />
        My first job after graduating, was in the Digital Search Marketing Industry for a company called Vertical Leap, where I worked as a software developer on the Apollo Insights team.
        In this role, I was able to apply and develop my skills in software development to aid a platform that ultimately helped businesses improve their online presence.
        Within the Apollo Insights team at Vertical Leap, I gained experience across the stack, using .NET and ASP.NET MVC alongside C#, while also working with frontend libraries and frameworks such as jQuery, RequireJS, and Vue.js.
        Also, within the team I was involved with database design, queries and optimisations including stored procedures, pagination and designing database tables.
        Within my time in this role, I also took on a support role to quicken my problem solving skills and to fix issues, so much so I was mentioned at a company meeting for my impact.
        As my experience grew, so did my tech stack.
        <br /><br />
        Later on in my time at Vertical Leap, I moved to the Process Innovation team, where I was able to work on a variety of projects, including the development of a new platform for managing and automating business processes.
        This role allowed me to work with a range of front end technologies, including Nuxt.js, Next.js and React.js, as well as with the technology cloud provider AWS.
        Here as well as developing full stack, I took on Dev Ops role to help with infrastucture and to aid on the occassions of migrating AWS accounts.
