Hi! I’m David, a full-stack software developer with experience building web applications that solve real problems and improve processes. I enjoy tackling challenges that require both technical skill and practical problem-solving.
</p>

<p class="mb-6">
I started my career during my placement year at Halliburton, developing a WinForms application to monitor oven temperatures for testing drilling equipment. Working closely with engineers and managers, I delivered software that directly supported critical testing processes — an experience that taught me the importance of precision, collaboration, and understanding user needs.
</p>

<p class="mb-6">
After graduating from Middlesex University, I joined Vertical Leap in the Digital Search Marketing industry. On the Apollo Insights team, I worked across the stack with .NET, ASP.NET MVC, C#, and frontend frameworks including Vue.js, jQuery, and RequireJS. I also designed and optimised databases, implemented stored procedures, and supported critical business processes. One of my contributions was recognised at a company-wide meeting for its impact.
</p>

<p class="mb-6">
Later, I moved to Vertical Leap’s Process Innovation team, building platforms to automate and improve business processes. I worked with Nuxt.js, Next.js, React.js, and AWS, including DevOps tasks such as domain migrations and cost management. These experiences helped me develop a strong understanding of how technology supports business goals.
</p>

<p class="mb-6">
Outside of work, I enjoy volunteering and side projects. I’m currently leading the development of a <strong>church website</strong>, applying modern frontend and deployment practices. I’ve also taken part in a <NuxtLink to="https://kingdomcode.org.uk/build/2024/"><strong>hackathon</strong></NuxtLink>, building a working prototype under tight deadlines — a great exercise in collaboration and rapid problem-solving.
</p>

<p class="mb-6">
Today, I focus on building scalable, full-stack applications with modern frameworks and cloud technologies, delivering software that works well and meets real needs.
